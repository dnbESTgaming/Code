# Mover bot

This a bot for application called Discord.  
It moves players based on the game they are playing to the specific voice channel.  
By default the bot is allowed to move everyone to everywhere expect when the user is in the AFK channel (That caused problems)  
The code might not be the cleanest and best optimized but it works.  
You have to change the voice channels IDs to make sure the bot works.  
You can change the bot name and the commands in the bot settings section.

* This bot uses [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/)
